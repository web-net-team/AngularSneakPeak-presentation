	h3 Modern browsers means the set of browsers known as â€˜evergreenâ€™ or always automatically updated to the latest version.  Building for these browsers let us drop many hacks and workarounds that make AngularJS harder to use and develop on than it needs to be.
	h3(data-enter="1") The set currently includes Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Safari, and IE10/11.  On mobile, weâ€™ll support something close to the list of Chrome on Android, iOS 6+, Windows Phone 8+ and Firefox mobile.  Weâ€™re looking into supporting older versions of Android, but the jury is still out.
